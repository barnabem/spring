	<h2>Why I love Spring?</h2>
	<p>I enjoy the season of spring because it swings the mood up. It comes between winter and summer and changes the temperature drastically. It is near the end of school, the temperature rising, and the lovely flowers that sprout from trees. You can start to see the greenery, and even though it is almost the same temperature as fall, fall is gloomy and not as joyful as spring. Trees gain their leaves unlike in the fall where they lose them. The good about spring too is the fact that bugs don't come out very often until way later in summer, so you still have time to go outside and enjoy the view before getting bit by a bug. However, spring does have a lot of rain but it is then replaced with warm weather. The season is fantastic and there is no way you can't like it.</p>
